I am a Research Scientist on TikTok's Responsible Recommendation Systems team, working on post-training lightweight vision-language models for content safety. I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani. My research explored topics in machine learning, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), Adversarial ML, Game Theory, and Transportation Systems. I concentrated on developing learning algorithms that effectively utilize data from diverse and suboptimal sources.
