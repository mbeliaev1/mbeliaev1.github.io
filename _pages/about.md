I am a current PhD candidate at the University of California Santa Barbara, working under Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani. My research experience throughout graduate school has been diverse, including topics such as Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, Adversarial Machine Learning, and Transportation Systems. My curiosity lies in understanding and uncovering the limitations of AI systems, a barrier we must overcome to facilitate the integration of AI systems into our daily lives. Apart from being an academic, I have been an avid rock climber for the past decade.
