I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California Santa Barbara, working under the supervision of Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani. My research focuses broadly on machine learning, encompassing topics such as Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial Machine Learning, Game Theory, and Transportation Systems. I am specifically interested in developing learning algorithms that effectively utilize data from diverse sources. Outside of academia, I have been an avid rock climber for over a decade.
