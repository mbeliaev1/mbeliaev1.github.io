I recently earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani. My research explored topics in machine learning, including Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial ML, Game Theory, and Transportation Systems. I focused on developing learning algorithms that effectively utilize data from diverse and suboptimal sources. Outside of research, I have been an avid rock climber for over a decade.
