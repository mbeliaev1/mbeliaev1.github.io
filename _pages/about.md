I recently earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Ramtin Pedarsani. My research explored topics in machine learning, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), Adversarial ML, Game Theory, and Transportation Systems. I concentrated on developing learning algorithms that effectively utilize data from diverse and suboptimal sources. I also have industry experience with Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on fine-tuning and prompt-engineering for multi-modal classification. I am especially interested in developing RL methods that enhance LLMs and Foundation Models for complex real-world tasks.
